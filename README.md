## 1. About the Project

Hi! This project was created to try to better understand what are indicators of good salaries when it comes to tech
careers. Since I'm Brazilian, I wanted to explore further my country's scenario in relation to salaries in tech jobs. 

I come from an engineering background and I saw many people fail in tests (including me), for example, because they 
had learned to solve some use cases, not the root concepts of the topic, and because of that they weren't able to 
generalize and solve new problems. I was curious to see 
*whether the programming languages devs with great salaries want to learn are the same ones students want* and what other
questions we could create from the results of this analysis.

I also wanted to know if American devs are better compensated in the US in comparison to Brazil (if so, how much). 
Maybe financially it could be a good idea to pursue a job that is compensated in USD (United States Dollar) if you are 
currently compensated in BRL (Brazilian Real). Another question that arised was whether Brazilian devs who are 
compensated in USD have better salaries than those compensated in BRL.

Finally, if is financially better to be compensated in USD than in BRL, one should look if salaries in both countries
are increasing or decreasing over time. Even if salaries are higher in the US than in Brazil, maybe in a few years this
discrepancy will decrease and pursuing a job compensated in USD won't be very interesting anymore for Brazilians.

## 2. Installations

All the packages necessary to be able to use the notebook can be found in the *requirements.txt* file

If you want to install them all, execute this command:

    pip install -r requirements.txt

## 3. File Descriptions

**1.** README.md - This file. This is the guide for the rest of the project :D
**2.** SO_survey_analysis.ipynb - This is the notebook containing the code used to the questions mentioned above 
and the plots in [my post on Medium](https://medium.com/@paulockoff/helping-brazilian-tech-professionals-to-understand-what-to-expect-in-terms-of-salary-f25e9e9ce990)
**3.** survey_results_public_2019.csv - CSV file containing the answers from the 2019 StackOverflow survey
**4.** survey_results_public_2020.csv - CSV file containing the answers from the 2020 StackOverflow survey
**5.** survey_results_public_2021.csv - CSV file containing the answers from the 2021 StackOverflow survey

## 4. Usage

Open the *SO_survey_analysis.ipynb* notebook and execute the cell with the *!pip install -r requirements.txt* command. 
After installing the necessary libraries, just execute the cells and check the result plots. Feel free to create new 
cells and further explore the data!
